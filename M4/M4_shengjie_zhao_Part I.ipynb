        "##Part I:  Vector Semantics and Motivation for Word Embeddings\n",
        "\n",
        "It is important to understand the words meaning (recall semantics) AND their context. Words that are seen in the similar context also often have similar meaning. The distributional hypothesis expresses this phenomenon saying that there is a link in similarity in how words are distributed and their likeness.  Vector semantics is the concept of learning representations of meanings of words – called embeddings—from their distributions in a corpus or corpora. Fundamentally, we are asking the question with NLP: how might we represent the meaning of a word and interpret it?\n",
        "\n",
        "A word embedding is simply a to represent words in a numerical context -- a vector.  This is important because Neural Networks and Machine Learning models don't learn on the text itself, but the numerical representation of the text. In fact, there is typically an \"embedding layer\" as part of the simplest NLP-based neural networks as you will find.\n",
        "\n",
        "The simplest way to show this is called a one-hot vector, other forms include term frequencies of words (as we have seen with Bayesian models), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, which normalizes terms across documents, and distributional representations, which are context-based encodings that help derive similarity-- i.e., \"queen is to female as king is to male\".\n",
        "\n",
        "We will start simple and discuss some of the challenges, then move to more complex transformations.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Setup\n",
        "As part of completing the assignment, you will see that there are areas in the note book for you to complete your own coding input.\n",
        "\n",
        "It will be look like following:\n",
        "```\n",
        "### START CODE HERE (REPLACE INSTANCES OF 'None' with your code) ###\n",
        "'Some coding activity for you to complete'\n",
        "### END CODE HERE ###\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Please be sure to fill these code snippets out as you turn in your assignment.\n"

        "\n",
        "A one-hot vector helps to translate categorical or sequential data to something that is machine readable and also does not have an impact on your model. Each word in the sequence is given a binary encoding and is mapped to a vector of the length of the the input. This is a common pre-processing step for the input layer in a neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "One hot encoding assigns a unique code for each unique word. As an example, we can take the following sentence and convert it to a one-hot vector.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever\"\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use NLTK to tokenize the sentence, then Sci-Kit Learn to apply the one-hot encoder. Note, that SK-Learn will apply a single value for a unique word in a vector which is great for categorical representations. This one-hot encoding has traditionally been used for feeding categorical data to many scikit-learn estimators in shallow learning models such as notably linear models and SVMs with the standard kernels.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: This approach is inefficient. A one-hot encoded vector is sparse (meaning, most indices are zero). Imagine you have 10,000 words in the vocabulary. To one-hot encode each word, you would create a vector where 99.99% of the elements are zero.\n"

Continuing the example above, you could assign 1 to \"live\", 2 to \"the\", and so on. You could then encode the sentence \"The cat sat on the mat\" as a dense vector. Now, instead of a sparse vector, you now have a dense one. A dense vector is a vector where all elements are populated with a non-zero value.\n",

With a simple BOW approach, no word order is considers. Moreover, we can filter words based on distributional counts -- that is, term frequencies. Imagine that the counts of a word fall into say a Gaussian (normal) Distribution across a number of corpora. We can use the distribution to filter out salient word-phrases or sequences in which we can infer the meaning of the text. Finally, we can apply weights to the frequency counts -- similar to weight vector in a NN-- in which those weights have an impact on word relationships or salience.\n",

        "\n",
        "Lexical semantics is a branch of linguistics focused on meaning and word relationships. Moreover, the idea behind word sense is the interpretation of the word (often requiring context to understand). Where multiple meanings can occur for a word – take the example of a mouse that can mean both the cursor controller and the rodent—we must discern using context. Relationships between word senses can be referred to as synonyms (e.g., couch/sofa).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Word Similarity** is not the same as a synonym, rather it is the idea that words have relationships. The example of cat and dog is used to show that while they are not synonymous, they are both animals, often they are domesticated – their semantics are similar.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Word relatedness** is slightly different than word similarity where there is more of a psychological association—for example, that coffee and cup are related.\n",
        "Recall that vectors for representing words are called embeddings implying that a point in space can be mapped to another point in space.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is important because word similarity (measured through a vector representing distance between two words in space) can be powerful for tasks we have previously done, such as sentiment analysis. Moreover, we can derive the meaning of the word using the nearby counts of similar words.\n",

        "We look at three similarity metrics to score word and/or document similarity:\n",
        "\n",

        "*   Euclidian Distance: is the shortest distance between two points in mathmatics. Not as useful in the field of NLP. The \"as the crow flies\" distance.\n",
        "*   Cosine Similarity: measure similarity based on the content overlap between documents.\n",
        "*   Jaccard Similarity: Used to identify documents we measure it as proportion of number of common words to number of unique words in both documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: Generally speaking the difference betweem *distance* and *similarity* is basically that distance is just equal to 1 - similarity.\n",
